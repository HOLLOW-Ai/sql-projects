# sql-portfolio
Hello to anyone landing on this page!

This is a repository where I practice in MS SQL on datasets I find online. Learned a bit of SQL in class in November 2024, and everything after has been me learning on my own. The folders should lead to their own project file with each containing their own SQL queries exploring and analyzing the contained datasets. There is only one project I have available called **amazon_purchases**, but more will pop up as I continue to practice. Eventually I want to focus more on performance and optimization, but for now I want to focus on the foundations.

# Dataset Sites
The following sites are where I peruse to find datasets that sound interesting:
- [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Awesome Data Repository](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
