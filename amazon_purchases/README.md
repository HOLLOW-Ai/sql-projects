## Dataset
The datasets can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YGLYDY). The file *amazon_purchases.csv* contains the purchase history of 5027 participants from 2018 to 2022. However, looking through the dataset shows multiple orders from 2023 and one order in 2024.

The other dataset *survey.csv* contains responses to a survey given to the 5027 participants that included demographic, amazon use, and personal questions.

Some things to note about this data is that participants were recruited online and offered monetary compensation for taking the survey. Additionally, participants needed to be 18 years or older, a U.S. resident, speak English, and have an Amazon account active in 2018. Considering this is an opt-in survey, it is possible to see demographics that are less represented in the dataset.
